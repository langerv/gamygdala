    This method is the main emotional interpretation logic entry point. It performs the complete appraisal of a single event (belief) for all agents (affected_agent=None) or for only one agent (affected_agent=True)
    if affected_agent is set, then the complete appraisal logic is executed including the effect on relations (possibly influencing the emotional state of other agents),
