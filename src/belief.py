Class Belief
Belief are annotated events.
This class is a data structure to store one Belief for an agent
A belief is created and fed into a Gamygdala instance (method Gamygdala.appraise()) for evaluation
Params:
* likelihood: The likelihood of this belief to be true.
* causal_agent_name: The agent's name of the causal agent of this belief.
* affected_goal_names An array of affected goals' names.
* goal_congruences An array of the affected goals' congruences (i.e., the extend to which this event is good or bad for a goal [-1,1]).
* is_incremental: Incremental evidence enforces gamygdala to see this event as incremental evidence for (or against) the list of goals provided, 
                i.e, it will add or subtract this belief's likelihood*congruence from the goal likelihood instead of using the belief as "state" defining the absolute likelihood
