Class Relation
This is the class that represents a relation one agent has with other agents.
It's main role is to store and manage the emotions felt for a target agent (e.g angry at, or pity for).
Each agent maintains a list of relations, one relation for each target agent.
Params:
* @param {String} targetName The agent who is the target of the relation.
* @param {double} relation The relation [-1 and 1].
